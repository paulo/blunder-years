     * 
     * For that, in the case of Client and Server that are different entities we 
     * will use interfaces.
     * If an interface is not sufficient, just split into two classes, there isn't too.
     * 
     * When an interface is not sufficient, the application should be separated
     * into two project's: 
     *  server project that know everything
     *  client
     * 
     * if required create 3ยบ project that is shared between this two.
